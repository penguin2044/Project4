				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					At In Bread, we take sandwiches seriously—because when something's
					going to be in your hands (and your mouth), it should be nothing short
					of amazing. Our mission is simple: craft high-quality, flavorful
					sandwiches using fresh, thoughtfully sourced ingredients, and serve
					them with a side of good vibes. Every sandwich we make is built with
					care, from our locally baked breads to our house-made sauces and
					perfectly paired fillings. Whether you're grabbing a quick lunch,
					catering a meeting, or just really knead a bite to eat, we've got you
					covered. We're proud to be your neighborhood sandwich spot—where
					quality comes first, and the puns are always complimentary. Because at
					the end of the day, we're not just in the sandwich business—we're In
					Bread.

							The Spring Fling Say hello to sunshine and fresh flavors! Our
							limited-time Spring Fling sandwich features lemon herb chicken,
							arugula, pickled onions, and a creamy dill aioli on toasted
							ciabatta. It's light, bright, and seriously delicious. We Just
							Turned One! In Bread is officially one year old! Thanks to all of
							you who've supported us (and eaten an impressive number of
							sandwiches). We celebrated with free cookies, cheesy giveaways,
							and, of course, cheesy sandwiches.
